\# Titanic - Machine Learning Project



This project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to explore data, perform feature engineering, and build predictive models.



\## Project Steps

1\. Data Exploration and Visualization

2\. Data Cleaning

3\. Feature Engineering

4\. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

5\. Model Evaluation



\## Dataset

\- \[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)



\## Tools Used

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Matplotlib, Seaborn

\- Scikit-learn



\## Results

The project shows how feature engineering improves model performance and compares different algorithms for predicting survival.
